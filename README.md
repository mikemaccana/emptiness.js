# Emptiness.js

A blank client-side web app with all the good things.

- A full skeleton set of js, images, css etc folders, editor config files, package.json and npm shrinkwrap, README.md, etc.
- SCSS, with live reloading, autoprefixer, a nice web font and border-box
- RequireJS, with the JSON and text plugins (used to load templates)
- Data binding, via the incredibly simple ractive.js
- Basic polyfills for vanilla JS
- Useful inbuilts, provided by agave.js, loaded with the 'av' prefix
- A small local server

## Why?

Rather than start new projects by copying old projects, I thought I'd maintain an empty project like this. You might find it useful too.

## Install

Run:

    npm install

## Run

Run `gulp` to start a server and live reload automatically.

## Seems good, I think I'll use this for my project, what next?

- Replace this README.md with your own
- Add a LICENSE.md for whatever your projects license is.
